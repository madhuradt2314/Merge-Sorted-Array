# Merge-Sorted-Array
Welcome to my LeetCode challenge repository! ðŸš€
In this repository, I'll be documenting my journey of solving 150 important LeetCode problems, one problem per day. The goal of this challenge is to enhance my problem-solving skills, improve my understanding of algorithms and data structures, and prepare myself for technical interviews.
Each day, I'll add a new problem along with its solution in Python (or any other preferred language) and any relevant explanations, insights, or alternative approaches that I find useful during my problem-solving process. I'll also include each question's problem statement and constraints to provide context.
Feel free to follow my progress, contribute your solutions, or provide feedback. Let's learn and grow together through this coding journey!
Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨

Day-1 
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].                                                                                                                                  
Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.

Constraints:
nums1.length == m + n
nums2.length == n
0 <= m, n <= 200
1 <= m + n <= 200
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109
